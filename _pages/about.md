**Research Interests**: I like to know how engineering systems work at the basic level. This steers me to do research in systems theory and statistics. My current research identifies situations where data science methods can address <strong>estimation, identification, and control</strong> problems in large-scale systems (e.g., power and mechanical systems). Situations:  

- estimation and control
   - sparse state and input estimation in linear dynamical systems
   - structured system identification in network systems
   - statistical inference in engineering graphical models
   - secure networked cyber-physical systems
- applications to power systems
   - parameter estimation in low-inertia systems
   - topology learning in distribution grids
   - oscillations and cyber-attack detection/localization/mitigation in bulk systems
  
**Academic roots**: Prior to joining to UMBC, I was a postdoc in the School of ECEE at Arizona State University. There, I worked with [Lalitha Sankar](https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/), [Oliver Kosut](https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/), and [Gautam Dasarathy](https://www.public.asu.edu/~gdasarat/). I received a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from University of California, Riverside. My thesis ([security of stochastic dynamical systems]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/raj_PHD_thesis2019.pdf){:target="_blank"}) supervisor was [Fabio Pasqualetti](https://www.fabiopas.it/). At UC Riverside, I took a bunch of courses in Statistics and earned an MS degree, but I remember only 51.32% of the course material. 

**Free time**: I listen to audiobooks on philosophical aspects of ethics and science; or muse about the stupid things I did as a teen (12-18 years); or amuse about the dense hair I had ages ago. In the hope of becoming an efficient writer, I read many books/articles on writing (fact: It took me ten attempts to write the prior sentence). If you like to chat about research or philosophy or writing or communication, drop me a line via email.
