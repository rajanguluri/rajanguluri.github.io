I'm interested in how engineering systems work at the deepest levels, which steers me to do research in systems theory. My current research identifies situations where <strong>estimation, identification, and control</strong> problems in large-scale systems (e.g., power and mechanical systems) can be solved using efficient computational algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Situations:  

- estimation and control
   - sparse state and input estimation in dynamical systems
   - controllability of coarse dynamical systems
   - structured system identification
   - structure learning in graphical models
   - attack design and detection in network systems
- applications to power systems
   - parameter estimation in low-inertia systems
   - topology identification in distribution grids
   - oscillations and cyber-attack mitigation in bulk systems
  
**Academic roots**: Iâ€™m a Postdoc-ing in the School of ECEE at Arizona State University, where I work with [Lalitha Sankar](https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/), [Oliver Kosut](https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/), and [Gautam Dasarathy](https://www.public.asu.edu/~gdasarat/). I received a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from University of California, Riverside. My thesis ([security of stochastic dynamical systems]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/raj_PHD_thesis2019.pdf){:target="_blank"}) supervisor was [Fabio Pasqualetti](https://www.fabiopas.it/). At UC Riverside, I took a bunch of courses in Statistics and earned an MS degree, but I remember only 51.32% of the course material. 

In my free time, I listen to audiobooks on philosophical aspects of ethics and science, remember my childhood memories, and think about the dense hair I had half a decade ago. If you like to chat, drop me a line via email.
