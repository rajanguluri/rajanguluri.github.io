Dr. Anguluri is a mathematical engineer and currently a postdoc in the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at Arizona State University. His research interests and activities include estimation and stochastic control, statistical learning, data sciences, and optimization. His current work develops tractable mathematical models using the above fields to address estimation and security problems in engineered and natural systems, including power grids, large-scale infrastructures, and brain networks. He holds a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering, a Masters degree in Statistics from the University of California, Riverside, and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India.

<strong>Note:</strong> A mathematical engineer formulates and solves mathematical problems encountered in engineering, for eg., control, signal processing, computation, communications, and image processing. (Why does he/she do such a thing? I'll get back to that in a minute.) Thomas Kailath, an emeritus professor at Stanford, attributes the terminology of mathematical engineering to Norbert Winer. In the introductory chapter of "Communications, Computation, Control, and Signal Processing: A Tribute to Thomas Kailath," he also laments that mathematical engineering did not receive as much popularity as mathematical physics. Yet, even the former is at the heart of many artificial systems surrounding us.
